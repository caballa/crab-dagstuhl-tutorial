# Crab tutorial for [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23281) # 

This repository contains the sources for building the Docker image
(read `crab.Dockerfile` for details).

In principle, you can also run *locally* the examples from the subdirectories:

- `clam-api-example`
- `clam-cli-example`
- `ebpf-example`

For that, you need to install 

- [crabber](https://github.com/caballa/crabber)
- [clam](https://github.com/seahorn/clam)
